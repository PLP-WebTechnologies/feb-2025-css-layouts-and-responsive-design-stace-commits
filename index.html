      <p>Caring means showing genuine concern for the well-being of others. It’s the small acts of kindness that build trust and connection between people. True care shines brightest when it expects nothing in return.</p>

    <section class="content">
      <h2>Section 2</h2>
      <p>When we care, we listen deeply and offer support without judgment. It’s about being present, even when we don’t have all the answers. Caring creates safe spaces where others feel seen and valued.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="content">
      <h2>Section 3</h2>
      <p>Caring for others also nurtures our own hearts. It reminds us that we are part of something bigger than ourselves. In a world that often rushes past, choosing to care is an act of quiet strength.</p>
